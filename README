README - Queueing System modeled as a Markov Chain

Overview
============

This code simulates a Queuing System modeled as a 
discrete time Markov Chain. Assuming an empty queue, 
incoming packets are not serviced until their number 
reaches a given threshold. If the queue becomes empty 
again, the aforementioned policy is followed. This 
policy is typical of a queueing system used for video 
streaming. 

Requirements
============

All you need is a recent gcc compiler version and the
C Standard Library. Just run $ make for compilation.

Usage
============

There are two ways to simulate queueing systems under
varying configurations: 

1) Using the bash script run_markov.sh . The value of 
   the required input parameters are specified in this 
   script

2) Running $ ./markov together with the required input 
   parameters

In either case, the required input parameters are the 
following:

First parameter: Queueing system capacity
Second parameter: Threshold for buffering incoming packets
without servicing them
Third parameter: Packet arrival rate
Fourth parameter: Packet service rate
Fifth parameter: Maximun number of simulation iterations
Sixth parameter: Eps
